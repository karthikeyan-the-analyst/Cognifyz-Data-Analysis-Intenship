# Restaurant-Data-Analysis
This project aims to analyze a dataset containing restaurant information. The analysis focuses on various aspects such as the distribution of ratings, the relationship between votes and ratings, the availability of online delivery and table booking across different price ranges, and identifying common positive and negative keywords in text reviews.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about restaurants, including columns such as:
- restaurant_id: Unique identifier for each restaurant.
- restaurant_name: Name of the restaurant.
- votes: Number of votes received by the restaurant.
- aggregate_rating: Average rating of the restaurant.
- rating_text: Text reviews for the restaurant.
- price_range: Price range of the restaurant.
- has_online_delivery: Indicates if the restaurant offers online delivery.
- has_table_booking: Indicates if the restaurant offers table booking.

➡ 𝐎𝐛𝐣𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞: To explore and analyze key metrics such as price ranges, delivery options, and customer ratings across a diverse range of restaurants.

➡ 𝐒𝐭𝐞𝐩𝐬 𝐈 𝐅𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐨𝐰𝐞𝐝:

✔𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐂𝐨𝐥𝐥𝐞𝐜𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Imported the dataset and handled missing values to ensure it was ready for analysis.

✔𝐄𝐱𝐩𝐥𝐨𝐫𝐚𝐭𝐨𝐫𝐲 𝐃𝐚𝐭𝐚 𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 (𝐄𝐃𝐀): I conducted an EDA to identify patterns and trends in the data. This included examining the distribution of restaurant price ranges, the proportion of restaurants offering online delivery, and the average ratings of these restaurants.

✔𝐕𝐢𝐬𝐮𝐚𝐥𝐢𝐳𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐨𝐧: Utilized Python libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn to create visualizations that clearly presented the data insights. These visualizations helped to uncover meaningful patterns and make the data more accessible.

✔𝐀𝐧𝐚𝐥𝐲𝐬𝐢𝐬 𝐨𝐟 𝐑𝐞𝐬𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐬: Delved into the analysis to understand how various factors like price range and delivery options impact customer ratings. This provided a clear picture of consumer preferences and business strategies in the restaurant industry.

➡ 𝐊𝐞𝐲 𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐢𝐠𝐡𝐭𝐬 & 𝐅𝐢𝐧𝐝𝐢𝐧𝐠𝐬:

➤ The majority of restaurants fall within a lower price range, with 46.53% offering budget-friendly options.

➤ About 25.66% of the restaurants provide online delivery, which has become a significant aspect of the dining experience.

➤ Restaurants that offer online delivery tend to have higher average ratings (3.25) compared to those that don't (2.47), indicating customer satisfaction with delivery services.

✨ This project has been an enriching experience, allowing me to hone my skills in data analysis, EDA, and visualization. I'm eager to leverage these insights in future projects and explore new tools and technologies!
